how have you been?
I tried to raise $150, but I could only raise $100.
I would really appreciate it if you would work with me
I have no doubt that if your good account and my skills are combined, great results will be achieved in the near future.
What do you think is the best way to hand over money?
Also, I would like to share your bank information. What do you think?
I have a suggestion, can you listen to it?
The idea is to buy connect with $50 and you get $50 first.
This is because if you first want to obtain an assignment without good feedback or stars, you must use a boost other than the allowed number of connections to easily bid on assignments worth more than $1000.
It may use 50 to 100 connections at a time.
It can be a bit difficult to bid on assignments without buy connect in your account, so I'd like to hear how you feel.
