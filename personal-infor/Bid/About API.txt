Hope you are doing well!
I can complete your issue such as problem of Customer addresses not appearing correctly on invoices causing gaps in billing process with perfect.
In my previous projects, I’ve worked extensively with Next.js, where I’ve implemented data flow solutions between front-end forms and back-end systems. For example, in one project, I had to resolve a similar issue where user data, including address details, wasn’t correctly reflected in the generated invoices. 
The problem was caused by the incorrect passing of form data to the API, which I traced back to a missing validation on the back-end. 
After fixing the validation and ensuring proper formatting, the issue was resolved, and invoices were correctly generated.
This experience matched the challenges of your project and it gave me the confidence to bid.
I have deep experience in debugging complex issues, especially with Next.js and managing client-side form data, as well as ensuring proper data flow between front-end inputs and back-end databases. Additionally, my knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and jQuery/Prototype allows me to work across the full stack and ensure smooth integration.
I am ready for you and waiting here.
Thank you.
