There’s an old saying from Steve Jobs that goes like this:
"Stay Hungry" - You can find a developer who is full of passion and great effort.
"Stay Foolish" - I’m always learning about new technologies.
The difference between greatness and mediocrity rarely depends on your talent. It's about your consistent effort, and refusal to put out a substandard product.
Are you tired of finding the right developer? or of wasting your time and losing the chance of success with the cheap trial with poor quality services?
Then, you found the right developer.
By ONLY providing premium service, I will build you an MVP to help you win the fund-raising, investments, and success.

Front-End Web dev
✅React ✅Angular
I felt like everything just clicked when I started full-stack JS development. It's a perfect convenience for developers, and it's a perfect choice for clients who want brand new sites.

Back-End Web dev
✅Node, ✅MongoDB, ✅GraphQL
I have more than 5 years of backend development, using Node(ExpressJS) and MongoDB. I like GraphQL a lot because of its efficiency and encapsulation.

Cloud and Dev-Ops
✅AWS, ✅GCP, ✅Docker
Beyond coding, the most important thing for us is the cloud. I have spent more than 30% of my time on AWS and GCP and it was a valuable experience.
And also Docker, it’s efficient and has cross-platform convenience.

AI backend
✅Python
My latest language is python. Many clients requested me to do some AI backend development using python, and in my opinion, it will be a new trend in the market.
There are tons of AI open-source and keeping version compatibility of libraries was essential.

Traditional Back-End Web dev
✅PHP, ✅Microsoft SQL Server, ✅MySQL, ✅Ajax
I have 9+years of PHP development, such as pure PHP, Laravel, Codeigniter.
Most of those used MSSQL, MySQL for the database.

With over 9 years of experience in Web and App development and a proven track record in building efficient, scalable, and innovative solutions, I am eager to bring my technical expertise and passion for problem-solving to your team.

Learning programming has been a transformative journey for me. From the outset, I realized that becoming proficient required significant dedication and relentless practice. While it was challenging at first, my persistence and curiosity drove me to continually improve. Every small milestone—mastering a new framework, solving a tricky coding problem, or optimizing a SQL query—became a rewarding step forward. Over time, I found not only confidence in my abilities but also genuine joy in the process of creating functional and elegant solutions.

In my professional journey, I have honed expertise in PHP, Laravel, and CodeIgniter frameworks, with advanced skills in MySQL database management and SQL optimization. Beyond this, my experience extends to over six years of web development using modern stacks like MERN, MEVN, and MEAN. This has equipped me to design and implement complex web applications that prioritize user experience and functionality. Additionally, I have over five years of experience with C#, ASP.NET MVC, and Unity 3D, enabling me to contribute to a wide range of technical projects.

My growth as a developer has not only been shaped by professional experiences but also by my personal interests. Reading has always been a favorite pastime of mine. Whether exploring technical books or delving into topics like psychology or history, reading has broadened my perspective and sharpened my problem-solving abilities. It has taught me to approach challenges methodically and view them as opportunities for growth.

A typical day in my life reflects my commitment to constant learning and improvement. I start my mornings by reviewing new advancements in technology or revisiting fundamental concepts to ensure my knowledge remains sharp. During work hours, I prioritize creating efficient and scalable solutions that align with client needs. Even in my downtime, I often find myself exploring new programming languages or frameworks, always looking to expand my skill set.

I am confident that my technical skills, combined with my ability to adapt and learn, will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team and help achieve specific company objectives.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my expertise to your company and would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your team’s needs.
Thanks.
